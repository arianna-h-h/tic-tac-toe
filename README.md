<b> Tick-tack-toe </b>

Tick-tack-toe game using React-Component.

<b> How it was created </b>

This project was created with 'create-react-app' through the tutorial at https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html

Aside from comments, the only modification made from the tutorial instruction is
changing string concatenations to use back tick format.
